# Hi there, my name is Cristina! ðŸ‘‹ :woman_technologist:

Iâ€™m a data scientist who takes pride in building models that translate data into business insights. Experienced and interested in all things data acquisition, data pre-processing, data modeling, statistical analysis, machine learning, natural language processing and deep learning. 

Iâ€™m based in NYC and have a background in psychology, health sciences and non-profit organizations. I have been learning and working mostly with Python, R, SQL, NumPy, Pandas, Keras, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Plotly, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Ubuntu, Linux, SPSS, Data Mining, ML, Hadoop, Spark, Docker, GCP, AWS, among others.

In my spare time I help organize data science events for [Data Umbrella](https://www.dataumbrella.org/), and when Iâ€™m not programming I like to spend time exercising, playing with my rabbit pet Popi, or travelling visiting my family in Spain.
